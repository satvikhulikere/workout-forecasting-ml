# 🏋️‍♂️ Workout Forecasting ML

A machine learning project to predict workout progress based on training data, nutrition, and recovery inputs.

## 📊 Project Structure

- `data/`: Raw or simulated workout datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling
- `streamlit_app/`: Dashboard (optional)
- `images/`: Visuals from EDA and model evaluation

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- Streamlit (optional)

## 🚀 Goals

- Predict future performance (e.g., weight lifted, reps)
- Visualize trends in training, sleep, and nutrition
- Explore ML techniques from regression to LSTM

## 📁 To Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
